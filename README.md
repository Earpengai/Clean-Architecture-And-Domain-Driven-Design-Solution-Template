## 1. Installation
I do recommend using CLI than VS Wizard when creating your application based on this template. This is because VS doesn't keep folders structure properly.

### 1.1 Solution Template Installation
```
dotnet new install Clean.Architecture.And.DDD.Template::1.0.0
```
### 1.2 Database

The template uses MSSQL as a database provider. Migrations will be applied automatically during project startup, so you don't have to do anything.

## 5. Observability
